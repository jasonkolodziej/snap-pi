#? The install hook is called upon initial install only, i.e. itâ€™s not called on subsequent refreshes.
#? The hook is executed before starting snap services (if it has any) and before the configure hook.
#? The install hook is the place for one-time actions, such as an early initialization of a resource
#? when installed for the first time.
