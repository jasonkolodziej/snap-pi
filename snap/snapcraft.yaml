# GLOBAL METADATA
## Reference: https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapcraft-yaml-reference
## The name must be unique in the Snap Store.
## Valid snap names consist of lower-case alphanumeric characters and hyphens.
## They cannot be all numbers and they also cannot start or end with a hyphen.
name: goplay2 # you probably want to 'snapcraft register <name>'
## The <base> keyword defines a special kind of snap that provides a run-time environment
## with a minimal set of libraries that are common to most applications.
## They’re transparent to users, but they need to be considered, and specified, when building a snap.
base: core22 # the base snap is the execution environment for this snap
version: '0.1' # just for humans, typically '1.2+git' or '1.3.2'
summary: Send audio to device running this snap using AirPlay 2 # 79 char long summary
description: |
  AirConnect can run on any machine that has access to your local network
  (Windows, MacOS x86 and arm64, Linux x86, x86_64, arm, aarch64, sparc,
  mips, powerpc, Solaris and FreeBSD). It does not need to be on your main computer.
  (For example, a Raspberry Pi works well). It will detect UPnP/Sonos/Chromecast
  players, create as many virtual AirPlay devices as needed, and act as a bridge/proxy
  between AirPlay clients (iPhone, iPad, iTunes, MacOS, AirFoil ...)
  and the real UPnP/Sonos/Chromecast players.

# ARCHITECTURES
## builds a snap to run on the same architecture as the build environment.
## ref: https://snapcraft.io/docs/architectures
architectures:
  #- build-on: arm64
#    build-for:
  - build-on: amd64
    build-for: arm64

# SECURITY MODEL
## Because devmode is only intended for development,
## snaps must be set to strict confinement before they can be published as “stable” in the Snap Store.
## Once an app is working well in devmode, you can review confinement violations,
## add appropriate interfaces, and switch to strict confinement.
confinement: devmode # use 'strict' once you have the right plugs and slots
## Defines the quality grade of the snap.
## Can be either devel (i.e. a development version of the snap,
## so not to be published to the stable or candidate channels) or
## stable (i.e. a stable release or release candidate, which can be released to all channels).
## A snap of type app (default) cannot be set to stable if the base is not on a stable channel.
grade: devel # must be 'stable' to release into candidate/stable channels

# PARTS
## are the raw building blocks of a snap, used to collect and build binaries and their dependencies.
## Parts define what sources are needed to assemble your app.
## Parts can be anything: programs, libraries, or other needed assets.
parts:
  ## The parts arbitrary name
  goplay2:
  ## The plugin field=(dump) determines how the information in specified in the source field
  ## and includes the source's contents in the snap.
  ## The source can be a local or remote zip file, deb file, or tarball.
    plugin: go
    ## (list of strings) Features used to build optional dependencies
    build-snaps:
      - go
    source-type: git
    source: https://github.com/openairplay/goplay2.git
    ## Before building the part, the packages listed in the build-packages section
    ## need to be installed in the build environment.
    ## These are the tools and libraries that are used during the build process.
    build-packages:
      - pulseaudio
      - libfdk-aac-dev
    stage-packages:
      - pulseaudio
      - libfdk-aac-dev
    ## These are packages containing libraries are resources that the final snap needs to run.
    ## They are very similar to those that would be listed as run-time
    ## dependencies on a standard distribution package.
    #stage-packages:
    ## You can override and customise steps of a part’s lifecycle (pull, build, stage, and prime) using overrides;
