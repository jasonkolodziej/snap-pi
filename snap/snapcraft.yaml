## The base keyword defines a special kind of snap that provides a run-time environment with a minimal set of libraries that are common to most applications. 
## They’re transparent to users, but they need to be considered, and specified, when building a snap.
base: core20

# Security Model

## Because devmode is only intended for development, 
## snaps must be set to strict confinement before they can be published as “stable” in the Snap Store. 
## Once an app is working well in devmode, you can review confinement violations, add appropriate interfaces, and switch to strict confinement.
confinement: devmode
## Defines the quality grade of the snap.
## Can be either devel (i.e. a development version of the snap, 
## so not to be published to the stable or candidate channels) or 
## stable (i.e. a stable release or release candidate, which can be released to all channels).
## A snap of type app (default) cannot be set to stable if the base is not on a stable channel.
# grade: stable | devel

# Parts
## Parts define what sources are needed to assemble your app. 
## Parts can be anything: programs, libraries, or other needed assets.
parts:
  ## The parts arbitrary name
  sharestream:
  ## The plugin field=(dump) determines how the information in specified in the source field and includes the source's contents in the snap. The source can be a local or remote zip file, deb file, or tarball.
    plugin: <type>
    source-type: tar
    source: <source>
    ## Before building the part, the packages listed in the build-packages section need to be installed in the build environment. These are the tools and libraries that are used during the build process.
    build-packages:
      - pkg1
    ##  These are packages containing libraries are resources that DOSBox needs to run. They are very similar to those that would be listed as run-time dependencies on a standard distribution package.
    stage-packages:
      - staged-pkg1
    ## You can override and customise steps of a part’s lifecycle (pull, build, stage, and prime) using overrides;
